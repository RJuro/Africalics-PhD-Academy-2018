        "# Training customized word embeddings\n",
        "\n",
        "Word embeddings became big around 2013 and are linked to [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3781) with the beautiful title \n",
        "*Efficient Estimation of Word Representations in Vector Space* by Tomas Mokolov et al. coming out og Google. This was the foundation of Word2Vec.\n",
        "\n",
        "The idea behind it is easiest summarized by the following quote: \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "> *You shall know a word by the company it keeps (Firth, J. R. 1957:11)*\n",
        "\n",
        "Let me start with a fascinating example of word embeddings in practice. Below, you can see a figure from the paper: \n",
        "*Dynamic Word Embeddings for Evolving Semantic Discovery*. Here (in simple terms) the researchers estimated word vectors for from textual inputs in different time-frames. They picked out some terms and person that obviousely changed *their company* over the years. Then they look at the relative position of these terms compared to terms that did not change much (anchors). If you are interested in this kind of research, check out [this blog](https://blog.acolyer.org/2018/02/22/dynamic-word-embeddings-for-evolving-semantic-discovery/) that describes the paper briefly or the [original paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00607).\n",
        "\n",
        "![alt text](https://adriancolyer.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/evolving-word-embeddings-fig-1.jpeg)\n",
        "\n",
        "Word embeddings allow us to create term representations that \"learn\" meaning from semantic and syntactic features. These models take a sequence of sentences as an input and scan for all individual terms that appear in the whole corpus and all their occurrences. Such contextual learning seems to be able to pick up non-trivial conceptual details and it is this class of models that today enable technologies such as chatbots, machine translation and much more.\n",
        "\n",
        "The early word embedding models were Word2Vec and [GloVe](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/).\n",
        "In December 2017 Facebook presented [fastText](https://fasttext.cc/) (by the way - by 2017 Tomas Mikolov was working for Facebook and is one of the authors of the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.04606) that introduces the research behind fastText). This model extends the idea of Word2Vec, enriching these vectors by information from sub-word elements. What does that mean? Words are not only defined by surrounding words but in addition also by the various sillables that make up the word. Why should that be a good idea? Well, now words such as *apple* and *apples* do not only get similar vectors due to them often sharing context but also because they are composed of the same sub-word elements. This comes in particularly handy when we are dealing with language that have a rich morphology such as Turkish or Russian.  This is also great, when working with web-text, which is often messy and misspelled.\n",
        "\n",
        "The current state-of-the-art (April 2018!) is ELMo (Embeddings from Language Models) that further tachkles the problem of contextuality and particularly polysemy i.e. same term means something else in a different context. \n",
        "\n",
        "You can read more about the ins and outs of the current state of  embedding models [here](https://medium.com/huggingface/universal-word-sentence-embeddings-ce48ddc8fc3a).\n",
        "\n",
        "Now the good news: You will find pre-trained vectors from all mentioned models online. They will do great in most cases. However, when working with specific tasks: Some obscure languages and/or specific technical jargon (finance talk), it is nice to know how to train such word-vectors.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this tutorial and on M3 we will not go further than fastText (2017-state-of-the-art should be good enough for us – sorry). You are more than welcome to use other, more sophisticated, embeddings.\n",
        "\n",
